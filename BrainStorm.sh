Let's use this space to determine what variables we want to compare/ look 
at!! 
Welcome to Team Pancakes! 

#Maggie: Should I look at does GDP predict life-expectancy? Guys, these are the instructions from Sakai. 
#What we need:
# 1. Load the data â€” DONE 
# 2. Contain plots that illustrate relationships between variables and cases where relationships do not exist
# 3. Contain plots with data divided by category as needed -- DONE (I think right?) 
# 4. Include captions and descriptions of plots-- DONE partially 
# 5. Show only informative output (not code or raw results)
# 6. Include R-squared and p-values as necessary to support relationships. These should be written in text not output as raw results.-- DONE partially 
# 7. Format text and results appropriately including headers and inline code.
